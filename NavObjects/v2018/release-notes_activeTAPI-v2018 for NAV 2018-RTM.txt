Release Notes                                                    20.01.2018

Use the attached activeTAPI.COM-DyNav_v2018_Setup.msi, to install activeTAPI v2018.

activeTAPI is a 32-bit program. But it runs with the 32-bit and the 64-bit version of NAV CLient
(because even the 32-bit-version of the NAV client is a 64-bit program. Strange ?!).

The NAV objects are based on NAV 2018 (RTM, 19394).

You can use the activeTAPI-Objects v2018 ONLY for NAV 2018 (may be with some changes for NAV 2017),
but not for older versions. The reason is, that with version 2017 we introduced events into activeTAPI. 
Therefore the structure changed at many places.

The needed objects in the license have also changed. You need    
7 Tables     (56780 - 56786)
3 Reports    (56780 - 56782)
4 Codeunits  (56780 - 56783)
13 Pages     (56780 - 56792)

The version code in NAV for activeTAPI-v2017 ist AT2018 (or AT2017 or AT2017.01 or other versions 
for older objects. All AT objects changeld for version 2018 are dated on 20.01.2018.

If you need activeTAPI for older versions of NAV, please contact us.

The changes in activeTAPI-v2018 are the same as in activeTAPI-v2017:
- activeTAPI now runs with the 64-bit and 32-bit NAV Client
- Introducing NAV-events, to minimize the changes in the NAV Standard Objects
- Create Setup Data as Action on the TAPI Setup Card
- Replacement of the activeTAPI-Timer by the new PingPong-Timer
- Object Numver of the Telephonie Menu was changed from 1055 to 1054 (1055 is OPPlus). Iy you need
  another object number, use the txt-Object of the Menu, to change the number
- Additional tests for correct installation:
  * If you activate "Use activeTAPI" in the User Setup, it is tested, if the TAPISetup exists and
    if at minimum one TAPI Line exists in NAV
- Complete update of the documentation
- and some minor corrections (errors in Captions, ...)

The changes for version 2018 (thanks to Peter) are:
- All events are now called with Parameter Var
- so some MODIFY in the event handler could be deleted
- and some GET after calling the event could be deleted
- Some corrections had to be done in the event handler, because some EventPublisherObject-definitions were wrong.
- in the vendor card the eventcall in the Lookup-Trigger of field "Phone No." had to be changed to 
  "ATEvPub.OnVendorPagesDialPhoneNo(Rec)".

We hope you enjoy the new version. Don't hesitate to give us hints and proposals.

Best regards
