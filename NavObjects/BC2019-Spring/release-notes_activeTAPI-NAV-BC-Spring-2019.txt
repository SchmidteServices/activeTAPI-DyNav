Release Notes                                                    17.08.2019

Use the attached activeTAPI.COM-DyNav_v2013_Setup.msi, to install activeTAPI-NAV-BC-Spring-2019 (AT-NAV-BC-Spring-2019)

The NAV objects are based on Dynamics 365 Business Central, Version Spring 2019 (Build 14.0.32600).

You can use the Objects of AT-NAV-BC-Spring-2019 ONLY for Dynamics 365 Business Central (may be with some changes for NAV 2017 / 2018),
but not for older versions. The reason is, that with version 2017 we introduced events into activeTAPI. 
Therefore the structure changed at many places.

The needed objects in the license have also changed. You need    
7 Tables     (56780 - 56786)
3 Reports    (56780 - 56782)
4 Codeunits  (56780 - 56783)
13 Pages     (56780 - 56792)

The version code in NAV for AT-NAV-BC-Spring-2019 ist AT2018 (or AT2017 or AT2017.01 or other versions 
for older objects). All objects changed for version AT2018 are dated on 17.08.2019.

If you need activeTAPI for older versions of NAV, please contact us.

The changes in AT-NAV-BC-Spring-2019 are the same as in activeTAPI-v2017/v2018:
- activeTAPI now runs with the 64-bit and 32-bit NAV Client
- Introducing NAV-events, to minimize the changes in the NAV Standard Objects
- Create Setup Data as Action on the TAPI Setup Card
- Replacement of the activeTAPI-Timer by the new PingPong-Timer
- Object Numver of the Telephonie Menu was changed from 1055 to 1054 (1055 is OPPlus). If you need
  another object number, use the txt-Object of the Menu, to change the number
- Additional tests for correct installation:
  * If you activate "Use activeTAPI" in the User Setup, it is tested, if the TAPISetup exists and
    if at minimum one TAPI Line exists in NAV
- Complete update of the documentation
- and some minor corrections (errors in Captions, ...)
The changes for version 2018 (thanks to Peter) were:
- All events are now called with Parameter Var
- so some MODIFY in the event handler could be deleted
- and some GET after calling the event could be deleted
- Some corrections had to be done in the event handler, because some EventPublisherObject-definitions were wrong.
- in the vendor card the eventcall in the Lookup-Trigger of field "Phone No." had to be changed to 
  "ATEvPub.OnVendorPagesDialPhoneNo(Rec)".

Changes in AT-NAV-BC-Spring-2019 (Version Code AT2018):
- The table locking was precised.
- The time, the Page 56781 "Incoming call" stays opened, can now be modified in the page (Loop in OnOpenPage).

We hope you enjoy the new version. Don't hesitate to give us hints and proposals.

Best regards
M. Gertz
