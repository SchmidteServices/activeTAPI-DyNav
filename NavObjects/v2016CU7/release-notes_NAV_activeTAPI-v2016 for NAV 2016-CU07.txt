Release Notes                                                    30.06.2016

The Setup-Program for activeTAPI v2016 is still in development.

Use the attached activeTAPI.COM-DyNav_v2013_Setup.msi, to install activeTAPI v2013.

The activeTAPI.RTC TimerControl.dll will be installed into
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Dynamics NAV\70\RoleTailored Client\Add-ins\activeTAPI.

You have to copy it into the path
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Dynamics NAV\90\RoleTailored Client\Add-ins\activeTAPI
for NAV 2016.

activeTAPI is a 32-bit program. Therefore it runs only with the 32-bit version of Navision
(see: https://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/library/mt299401(v=nav.90).aspx).

Inside of NAV 2016, you use the AT-v2016-objects.

The NAV objects are based on NAV 2016 (Cummulative Update 7) and were developed 
with Build 45834.

From AT-v2015 to AT-v2016 only minor changes were made. The objects were only adapted to the new
NAV Version and have Date 18.06.2016 and time 13:00:00.
The 2 modified objects have version No. AT2016 and are dated from 30.06.2016.

So here I repeat the changes made in NAV 2015 (AT-v2015).

1) The follwing changes were made in Navision:
The Version-Code is AT2015.

a) There were some troubles with NAV 2013 (R2) and the Excel-Addin.
To avoid this, we added a .NET-Check in Codeunit 40 (thanks to Cajus).

b) In Report 56780 "Fill Phone Index" there was no Request Page. It was added now.

c) In Page 56784 "TAPI Logs" there is a page action "Dial" (Anrufen). The Code was 
changed. Now always the Remode ID is dialed (if not empty).

d) In the Table 56782 TAPI Setup there is new field "Runs in Developer Mode".
This field can only be changed directly in the table (developers should know 
how to do this ...).
If it is activated, activeTAPI automation object "TAPI Functions SI" and Startpage 56785
are not started in Codeunit 40, LoginStart.
So Developers, that have not installed activeTAPI, will not get automation
errors anymore. But take care: You should also deactivate "Format Phone Numbers"
and "Format Fax Numbers" in the TAPI SetUp. Otherwise you will get automation
errors, if you change any Phone or Fax No.
AND: Don't forget, to deactivate "Runs in Developer Mode" at the end of your work.

e) In former version of activeTAPI, the event-receiving Startpage (Page 56785) was 
started by a Page.RUN command in the properties of the NAV RTC-Icon. This is no more
necessary. It is started now in Codeunit 40 in function LoginStart. This solves
problems while changing the Company.

f) In the Standard, Page 56785 "Page with Timer" is not visible, because it has 
PageType ConfirmationDialog (thanks to Peter). This did not work with Build 37874 (RTM),
but it works since Build 39368 (Cummulative Update 3). Iy you want so see the Page, for 
example in development, change the PageType to Card.

g) If the activeTAPI-objects were imported into an database, but activeTAPI was not
installed, the RT-Client crashes while starting Codeunit 56782 "TAPI Functions SI".
To avoid this, a new Veriable ATPhoneRunning was introduced in CU 56782 (thanks to Heiko).

h) In the Codeunits 5055, 5056 and 5057 modify of "Phone No." is only called, if  
Phone No. changed (thanks to Peter), Version Code AT2015.1.
 

2) Older Versions of NAV

In the future we will have different versions of activeTAPI:
- activeTAPI-DyNAV v2011.3   for all NAV versions from 2009 SP2 with CC and RTC
- activeTAPI-DyNAV v2013     for all NAV version 2013 and R2
- activeTAPI-DyNAV v2015     for NAV version 2015
- activeTAPI-DyNAV v2016     for NAV version 2016


3) Feed back

We hope you enjoy the new version. Don't hesitate to give us hints and proposals.
