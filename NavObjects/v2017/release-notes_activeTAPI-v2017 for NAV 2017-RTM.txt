Release Notes                                                    14.01.2017

Use the attached activeTAPI.COM-DyNav_v2017_Setup.msi, to install activeTAPI v2017.

activeTAPI is a 32-bit program. But it runs with the 32-bit and the 64-bit version of NAV CLient
(because even the 32-bit-version of the NAV client is a 64-bit program. Strange ?!).

The NAV objects are based on NAV 2017 (RTM, 13682).

You can use the activeTAPI-Objects v2017 ONLY for NAV 2017 (may be with some changes for NAV 2016),
but not for older versions. The reason is, that we introduced events into activeTAPI. 
Therefore the structure changed at many places.

The needed objects in the license have also changed. You need    
7 Tables     (56780 - 56786)
3 Reports    (56780 - 56782)
4 Codeunits  (56780 - 56783)
13 Pages     (56780 - 56792)

The version code in NAV for activeTAPI-v2017 ist AT2017, all AT objects are dated on 14.01.2017.

If you need activeTAPI for older versions of NAV, please contact us.

The changes in activeTAPI-v2017 are:
- activeTAPI now runs with the 64-bit and 32-bit NAV Client
- Introducing NAV-events, to minimize the changes in the NAV Standard Objects
- Create Setup Data as Action on the TAPI Setup Card
- Object Numver of the Telephonie Menu was changed from 1055 to 1054 (1055 is OPPlus). Iy you need
  another object number, use the txt-Object of the Menu, to change the number
- Additional tests for correct installation:
  * If you activate "Use activeTAPI" in the User Setup, it is tested, if the TAPISetup exists and
    if at minimum one TAPI Line exists in NAV
- Complete update of the documentation
- and some minor corrections (errors in Captions, ...)

We hope you enjoy the new version. Don't hesitate to give us hints and proposals.

Best regards
M. Gertz
